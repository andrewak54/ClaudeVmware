From: VMware kernel 6.17 compatibility patches
Subject: [PATCH 3/5] vmmon: add compat defines for renamed kernel 6.x APIs

Two functions were renamed in the kernel:
  - del_timer_sync()  -> timer_delete_sync()  (kernel 6.15, commit 97db4fd)
  - rdmsrl_safe()     -> rdmsrq_safe()        (kernel 6.x MSR API overhaul)

Without this, linux/driver.c:349 and linux/hostif.c:3413 fail with
"implicit declaration of function" errors.

Applies to: vmmon-only/include/compat_version.h
